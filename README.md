# FirstProject
First template project built by HTML &amp; CSS.

This website was created as a collaborative project to explore and
strengthen our web development skills, particularly in front-end design.
As part of our enrolled course, we were tasked with building a template
store for websites using only HTML and CSS.

The project presented significant challenges, especially given the
limited timeframe of just a few days. However, through effective
collaboration and teamwork with my teammate \@MennaFathi87, we were able
to overcome these obstacles and deliver a functional and visually
appealing website.

This experience not only deepened our understanding of front-end
development but also laid a strong foundation for our future endeavors
in the web development world. We view this project as the starting point
of our journey, and we look forward to building more complex and dynamic
websites in the future, Insha\'Allah (ISA).
